# Project-C-Parking-Lot

First Project i've ever done in C, learning the fundamentals of programmming such as Data Structures and Pointers.
Objective of The Project:
--> Create a Simulated Parking Lot where with each input in the terminal different outputs would be received, for an example you would pass onto the terminal the letter "f Day/Month/Year" if you wanted to see every single car that had entered the parking lot on that specific date.
